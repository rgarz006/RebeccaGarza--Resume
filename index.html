        <div class="subheading mb-5">ðŸ“ºMedia and Cultural StudiesðŸ“°</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Rebecca, and I am currently a second year student at the University of California, Riverside. I am currently majoring in media and cultural studies as well as minoring in theatre, film, and digital production. I aspire to graduate from UCR, and continue my schooling to one day become Dr. Rebecca Garza!

I enjoy cooking, and listening to music. My favorite dish to make is grilled chicken with a side of seared spinach. It is a simple, yet healthy meal to cook on the go. While I cook, I enjoy listening to music. I enjoy a wide variety of music genres, but I would say that my top three favorite genres would have to be: rock, musical theatre, and new wave.
<br><br>

        I am currently working as an orientation leader for Highlander Orientation. Through this job, I am building my communication skills for future job opportunities. Public speaking is a huge part of this job as I will be speaking to many incoming students who will soon begin their college career at UCR. My job is to inform students about the many opportunities, and resources UCR has to offer as well as answer any questions these incoming students may have. I enjoy assisting others. 

In the past, I have had experience helping students. I was a tutor for a very long time. I volunteered at an elementary school during the spring and assisted students in the subjects of math, and english to help these students higher their scores for the state standard test at the end of the year. In addition to this, I was an intern at my high school. I was a summer bridge leader and I helped incoming first year students learn about their new high school as well as learn about the different resources available that our high school has to offer. My high school, and AltaMed teamed up and created this summer bridge opportunity for students, and summer bridge leaders to learn about mental health and what unhealthy, and healthy habits look like that impact the mind. I was trained on this subject, and then I taught these incoming students about mental health.
<br><br>

        All in all, from past experiences, Iâ€™ve learned to communicate with others, and Iâ€™ve learned how to balance my work with my education. I am a hard worker, and a very reliable person. I strive to continue my education, and gain real life experiences.
